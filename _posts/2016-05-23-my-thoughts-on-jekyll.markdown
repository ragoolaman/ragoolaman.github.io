This is my first post after the creation of this GitHub Pages site. In this I will talk a bit about my opinion on using Jekyll for this kind of site creation.

So, I created all of these Jekyll base files through Codecademy.com, which is an amazing site for learning programming. Highly reccomended!
After using something like that, it can be difficult to learn how to do things with Jekyll.
Word of advice: Whenever a Jekyll guide says something like "refresh the site with 'Jekyll serve'", don't scratch your head, as GitHub will refresh it FOR you!
Took me time to figure that out, believe me! 
If your changes never show up, then check your email, chances are there is a typo, or syntax error. GitHub emails you about website compile errors, and ignores changes until fixed!

Happy website making!

-Ragoola out!
