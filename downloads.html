  <h1>The list of games I have created:</h1>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/Isratosh/gameproject">Kingdom Feller</a></li>
  </ul>
  <p>Made with <a href="https://github.com/Isratosh">Isratosh</a>. I did most of the work ; ), that is why the game is about killing King Isratosh, and I help you do it. It has a text based interface, and is done in Java. This game is a culmination of two, nearly three months of coding and planning.</p>
